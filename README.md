# TwitchSpinBot
Spin a wheel and get random rewards!

Made for use with [Piggy26YT's Twitch channel](twitch.tv/Piggy26YT) (check him out!).

## How does it work?
When a channel point reward called "SPIN THE WHEEL" is redeemed on Twitch, this bot will spin a wheel (choose randomly) a reward. This reward is then put into chat by a seperate bot. If the reward is not acceptable, the broadcaster, a mod or "sbeveuwu" on twitch can use !respin to get another result!
